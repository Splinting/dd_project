WARNING: [Labtools 27-3361] The debug hub core was not detected.
Resolution: 
1. Make sure the clock connected to the debug hub (dbg_hub) core is a free running clock and is active.
2. Make sure the BSCAN_SWITCH_USER_MASK device property in Vivado Hardware Manager reflects the user scan chain setting in the design and refresh the device.  To determine the user scan chain setting in the design, open the implemented design and use 'get_property C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN [get_debug_cores dbg_hub]'.
For more details on setting the scan chain property, consult the Vivado Debug and Programming User Guide (UG908).

WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/DD_Proj/project_1/project_1.srcs/constrs_1/new/constrant.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.

WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/DD_Proj/project_1/project_1.srcs/constrs_1/new/constrant.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.

Finished Parsing XDC File [C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/DD_Proj/project_1/project_1.srcs/constrs_1/new/constrant.xdc]
WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/DD_Proj/project_1/project_1.srcs/constrs_1/new/constrant.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.

WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/DD_Proj/project_1/project_1.srcs/constrs_2/new/constrant.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
